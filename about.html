          <h2 class="cv-detail">My Journey</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Year 2008</b>, I started my bachelor degree in Applied Statistics. Even though I had no
            idea what the hell is that. Most of my class mates including me found it very boaring
            and did not have any intention to be a statistician at the end. But as times goes on
            I switched my self to another direction. I tried to go more deep in to statitics and was
            able to find the interesting parts of statistics.<br> <br>
            <b>Year 2014</b>, after finishing my masters I stared to look for job. But I discovered that,
            knowing only statistics is not enough to get a job in the relevent field. Because the
            way university structured statistics; is it just teach you from a csv file or built in data
            how to build a model and how to work with a model based on simulation. Where as in real life
            data is always stored in a humangas database or no sql collections and you need to know
            how to interact with the database to download the data or preprocess the data
            using sql or nosql in real time. So I took a diploma on Database Design and development.
            <br><br>
            <b>End of 2014</b>, I get the job as Data Analyst ( Soft. Engineer) in IMS Health, Bangladesh
            (currently known as IQVIA). Which is a Health Informatics company and I joined as a more
            or like data engineer. Actually by that time that kind if role has been called mosty database
            developer which includes zero statistical knowledge and 100 percent database technology
            knowledge such as SSIS, Table, Cubes, data warehousing and Business Intelligence. So I
            keep searching for more relevent data science stuff. <br> <br>
            <b>End of 2015</b>, One cold September scilently I left my homeland and come to Prague, Czech
            Republic with an Scholarship provided by Czech Government. I start my course in System
            engineering and Informatics. I have written it in few simple line but that decision
            brings the biggest impact in my life and what I do as my job currently.<br> <br>
            <b>In the middle of 2016</b>, One summer day, I join McKinsey & Company - Prague as a Junior
            Reporting Analyst. Still the best place I ever worked in my life. But it was a part-time job.
            So I was studying and working both at the same time. It was very intersting job and something
            I really wanted. That was my actual first step to Data Science and Advance Analytics. There I
            familiered myself with variety of tech. and tools. It was very friendly environment
            with such amazing peoples. One benifit I can tell about working in big corporate is easy to
            get approval and finance to use any new technology even it is expensive. <br><br>
            <b>May 2018</b>, I became an Amazonian by joining Amazon HRS Czech Republic. It was kind
            of big place to start working with high hope. But I did not like the company culture that much.
            So before its too late I decided to leave as early as I can. So I start to find job
            immediately. <br><br>
            <b>September 2018</b>, I join Socialbakers. So far the second best company I have worked in
            my life and still working. As time goes on I get familier with whole lot of technology, new
            architecture of software developement, new wave of Data Science and ML and advalce data
            visualization so on. <br><br>
            So along with time from database developer with SSIS, I become Data Science and Advance
            Analytics Developer with Spark, Tensorflow and Keras etc. But I can tell the whole journey
            was not that easy. It containts a lot of <b>dedication, secrifice, hard work and motivation.</b>
            <br><br>
            I am one of the back benchers having bad CGPA but still working in statistics related field.
            Where as most of the good students or atleas having CGPA better than me are actually
            left statistics and working in GOVT. servies or bank job. The reason I have made it possible so
            far because I think I was really interested in statitics and I had that vision to simplefy
            the tuff statistics atleast for me.
          </p>
          <h2 class="cv-detail">Experience & Technology</h2>
          <p>
            <b>In IMS health</b>, I started working as database developer where I lerned about standard data
            warehousing technology, such as building data pipeline (ETL) with SSIS, working with
            star schema desigh database, running data production and creating data testing models. <br><br>
            <b>During my years in McKinsey & Company</b>, I mostly worked in data integration with Alteryx,
            Snaploogic and advance analytics with Tableau, Power BI and Python. The main focus of our team was
            building analytical dashboard of products and their usages, which help mamagement to simplify
            the workflow I guess. <br><br>
            <b>My short stay in Amazon HRS</b> I mostly worked Trouble Ticket Reporting,
            Pay Defect Reporting and several survey data survey analysis. Here main technology
            we ware using is Redshift, Python and Tableau for whole reporting pipeline and
            few internal in house product from Amazon as a replacement of ETL. <br><br>
            <b>My Current stay in Socialbakers</b> has two fold work. From one part I work as
            back-end python developer for several data analytics ad-hoc project, but also I
            am working in several Deep Learning and Computer Vision Projects. Here the main tech.
            we use are Pyspark, No SQL, Python and other advance tools.
          </p>
          <h2 class="cv-detail">Academic</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Do not want to go that far</b>, I will start from University. So I did my bachelors
            from Institute of Statistical Research and Training (ISRT) in Applied Statistics. That
            institute is a part science faculty of University of Dhaka. Where actually I
            learned all the aspects of statistics. <br><br>
            <b>I have two masters</b>, First masters I did from ISRT in Applied Statistics. It's kind
            of a tradition now in my country that you should have masters but from my point of view
            obviously it does not have any added value in modern Data Science revolution, where we
            need more practical information, knowledge about how to use such reach API (like Pandas
            for data manipulation, scikit-learn for ML etc.) and master them. where as Studying masters
            is very general theoritical study. My second masters is in System Engineering and
            Informatics from Czech University of Life Science. The reason of doing that masters is
            actually that was the only way I could switch my job, my environment, my place and the
            topics I am interested in. <br><br>
            <b>But also would like to mention schools</b> I have studied. My first school was
            St.Joseph's School Dinajpur. where I studied from 1st gread to 3rd gread.
            Then until my first certificate examp. (Secondary Certificate Exam.), I studied in
            Dinajpur Zilla School. I did my Higher Secondary Course in Notre Dame College,
            Dhaka and joinded University after that.
          </p>
          <h2 class="cv-detail">Interest</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Data Analytics</b> is ofcourse is an interesting topics for me. But apart from that
            I have my own world of <b>Music</b>. Where I compose music, make <b>Guitar Instrumental</b>
            and try to experiment with acoustic instrument. If I would not be a Data Science Developer
            I would choose to be a full time guitarist and composer.<br><br>
            My interests in topics or tools related to Data Science often changes. For example I started
            learning D3.js and found it interesting but could not continue at the end, last year. But then
            this year I have started learning it again and realising there is a lot of change in d3.js 4.x
            to 5.x. I am also trying out pixidust data analysis tool and it looks interesting. This year
            my goal is to take full grasp of Computer Vision, Deep Dive in the Tensorflow and PyTorch if
            possible.

            <p>
              Though I am not that much active in the tech and Data Science community. But I try my best
              to contribute when it is possible. Here is some of the platform you can find me and can
              add me. Hope One day I will be free from work and will try to contribute more and more in
              Data Science and open source community.
